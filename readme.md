#spranimate
-----------
###Ever wanted to take an ordinary, boring spritesheet and turn it into a glorious, animated wonder?
Then then spranimate is for you!
This is not something to be used in games, it's simply a script to make nice presentations for your spritesheets

It's very basic now, I plan on expanding it if I can.

#Usage
-----------
Spranimate takes two parameters, `htmlImageObject`, the spritesheet to animate, and `options`, an object of options. All three options shown in the example files.

```javascript
Spranimate(document.getElementById("image"), {
	height: 16,
	width: 16,
	framerate: 10
});
```

#FAQ
------------

###Can I use spritesheets with several rows?
Yes

###Can I pause the animation?
No

###Can I make coffee with the script
No, what's wrong with you?
